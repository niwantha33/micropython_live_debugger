# MicroPython Live Debugger

A live, bytecode-level debugger for MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.
Set breakpoints, step through code, inspect named locals, view the call stack,
and use **conditional breakpoints** — all on a running board, over USB, with a
VS Code UI.

No JTAG. No `sys.settrace`. No print-debugging.

## Features

- **Breakpoints** — click in the gutter, just like a real debugger
- **Step over / step in / step out / continue**
- **Named locals** — see `x = 32, y = 30, z = 62` not raw stack slots
- **Call stack** with function names, click a frame to jump to source
- **Conditional breakpoints** — `b > 1`, supports Python `and / or / not`
- **Live line highlight** of the paused line
- **Auto-upload** of debugger files via "Start Debug" button
- **Robust port handling** — friendly errors when COM port is busy
- **Two USB CDCs** — debugger frames on CDC1, REPL stays untouched on CDC0

## Target hardware

**Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350).** Dual USB-CDC built in.

ESP32-S3 port planned for v0.2.

## Quick start

### 1. Flash the firmware

1. Hold **BOOTSEL**, plug Pico USB in — it appears as `RP2350` drive
2. Drag `firmware.uf2` onto it
3. Pico reboots automatically

### 2. Install the VS Code extension

```
code --install-extension micropython-studio-1.0.0.vsix
```

Or in VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Install from VSIX**.

### 3. First debug session

1. Open a `.py` file with a function (`def foo(): ...`)
2. Click the **▶ Start Debug** button in the status bar
3. Click in the gutter to set a breakpoint
4. In the REPL: `import yourfile; yourfile.foo()`
5. Execution pauses at your breakpoint. The panel shows locals + call stack.

## How it works

We patch the MicroPython VM (`py/vm.c`) with a one-line hook in the bytecode
dispatch loop. The hook calls into a new module `moddbg.c` which:

- Holds the breakpoint table (slot → ip) and stepping flags
- Snapshots a shadow call stack at pause time
- Exposes `dbg.set_bp / clear_bp / locals / frame_info / call_stack / resume / step / step_in / step_out` to Python

A Python-side **trace pump** (`trace_pump.py`) runs in a second thread, drains
debug frames from the C ring buffer to a dedicated USB-CDC interface, and
parses commands from the host.

The VS Code extension talks to that CDC port via `dbg_bridge.py` (pyserial),
parses event frames (`bp_hit`, `reply`), and renders the UI. Conditional
breakpoints are evaluated **client-side in the extension** — when a BP fires
with a condition, the extension fetches locals, evaluates `b > 1` in JS, and
either pauses or silently resumes.

## Building from source

Requires WSL (or Linux/macOS) with the Pico SDK toolchain installed.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/niwantha33/micropython_live_debugger
cd micropython_live_debugger
export MPY_DIR=$HOME/micropython
git clone --recursive https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git $MPY_DIR

# Build all firmwares (Pico W, Pico 2 W, Pico, Pico 2)
cd firmware
./build.sh
```

The script [build.sh](file:///c:/Claude_Projects/micropython_debugger/firmware/build.sh) automatically:
1. Resets the MicroPython repository to a clean state.
2. Applies all patches sequentially.
3. Clears stale CMake configurations for each target.
4. Generates four separate `.uf2` firmware binaries in the `firmware/` directory:
   * `firmware_pico_w.uf2` — Raspberry Pi Pico W (Wi-Fi RP2040)
   * `firmware_pico2_w.uf2` — Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (Wi-Fi RP2350)
   * `firmware_pico2.uf2` — Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (non-Wi-Fi RP2350)
   * `firmware_pico.uf2` — Raspberry Pi Pico (non-Wi-Fi RP2040)

## Wire protocol

Frames are `[0xAA][type][len][payload]`.

| Type | Direction   | Meaning           |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0x01 | board → pc  | trace event       |
| 0x02 | board → pc  | bp_hit            |
| 0x03 | board → pc  | reply text        |

## Status

**v1.0.1 — bugfix release.** Stable end-to-end on Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

### v1.0.1 changes
- Upload corruption fixed (raw-paste flow control)
- Download corruption fixed (HEXLEN/HEXSTART markers + chunked print)
- Single-file and folder uploads now share the reliable one-shot path
- mip PC-side fallback works again on devices without WiFi
- Shell terminal no longer leaks venv-activate text into the REPL

Verified working with:
- Synchronous code (loops, function calls, recursion)
- **Async code** — breakpoints hit inside `asyncio` coroutines
- Multi-frame call stacks (3+ levels deep)
- Conditional breakpoints with Python operators

Known limitations:
- Step-in across function boundaries doesn't update the source highlight
  (only known BP locations are mapped to lines)
- BPs are limited by firmware slot count (default 8)
- No watch expressions yet
- Only one breakpoint condition at a time (no hit-counts)
- VS Code Python extension auto-activates venv into terminals — disabled
  workspace setting on first run

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Next:
- ESP32-S3 port
- Watch expressions
- Persistent device console (one port owner, no contention)
- Variable edit (poke value into running program)
